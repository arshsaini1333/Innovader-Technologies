  {name:"Neha M", desg:"Real EstateÂ Consultant", review:"Our listings finally started getting real attention. Thanks to the Google Ads campaign, we generated 200+ leads in just 30 days â€” with actual conversions. Super impressed!"},
  {name:"RahulÂ S", desg:"Realtor", review:"The Facebook and Instagram campaigns were beautifully designed and laser-targeted. I was blown away by how quickly inquiries started coming in â€” and they were real buyers, not just curious browsers."},
  {name:"Simran D.", desg:"Real Estate Agent,Â DelhiÂ NCR", review:"The creative + targeting = gold. We closed three high-ticket deals through leads we got via Meta Ads in just two months."},
  {name:"KunalÂ J.", desg:"Broker", review:"All the landing pages and organic forms were so well-optimized that we were able to capture quality leads without spending on ads. Itâ€™s an efficient and sustainable system."},
  {name:"PoojaÂ M.", desg:"Agent", review:"What amazed me was the quality of the organic inquiries. They werenâ€™t just random people â€” they were ready to buy or invest. The lead forms on our website are working like magic."},
  {name:"Ritika B.", desg:"PropertyÂ Consultan", review:"Weâ€™ve tried ads before, but this was the first time we actually saw consistent inquiries. Nothing fancy â€” just well-placed ads, the right landing page, and leads that actually answered the phone."},
  {name:"Anil S.", desg:"Independent RealÂ EstateÂ Agent", review:"Honestly, I wasn't sure if digital lead gen would work for real estate, but within a couple of weeks I started getting calls from serious buyers. The team didnâ€™t overpromise â€” they just delivered. Simple and effective."},
  {name:"Farah K.", desg:"RealÂ EstateÂ Agent", review:"What I liked most is that the leads didnâ€™t feel random. They were coming through with genuine interest â€” and the forms were simple, not annoying to fill out. Weâ€™ve closed two deals already from just one campaign."},
  {name:"JayantÂ P.", desg:"SoloÂ Agent", review:"I didnâ€™t have time to figure out ads or SEO â€” I just needed leads. These guys set everything up, and now I get at least 3â€“4 qualified leads a day. Itâ€™s taken a huge load off my shoulders."},
