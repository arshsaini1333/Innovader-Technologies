  {name:"Neha M", desg:"Real Estate Consultant", review:"Our listings finally started getting real attention. Thanks to the Google Ads campaign, we generated 200+ leads in just 30 days — with actual conversions. Super impressed!"},
  {name:"Rahul S", desg:"Realtor", review:"The Facebook and Instagram campaigns were beautifully designed and laser-targeted. I was blown away by how quickly inquiries started coming in — and they were real buyers, not just curious browsers."},
  {name:"Simran D.", desg:"Real Estate Agent, Delhi NCR", review:"The creative + targeting = gold. We closed three high-ticket deals through leads we got via Meta Ads in just two months."},
  {name:"Kunal J.", desg:"Broker", review:"All the landing pages and organic forms were so well-optimized that we were able to capture quality leads without spending on ads. It’s an efficient and sustainable system."},
  {name:"Pooja M.", desg:"Agent", review:"What amazed me was the quality of the organic inquiries. They weren’t just random people — they were ready to buy or invest. The lead forms on our website are working like magic."},
  {name:"Ritika B.", desg:"Property Consultan", review:"We’ve tried ads before, but this was the first time we actually saw consistent inquiries. Nothing fancy — just well-placed ads, the right landing page, and leads that actually answered the phone."},
  {name:"Anil S.", desg:"Independent Real Estate Agent", review:"Honestly, I wasn't sure if digital lead gen would work for real estate, but within a couple of weeks I started getting calls from serious buyers. The team didn’t overpromise — they just delivered. Simple and effective."},
  {name:"Farah K.", desg:"Real Estate Agent", review:"What I liked most is that the leads didn’t feel random. They were coming through with genuine interest — and the forms were simple, not annoying to fill out. We’ve closed two deals already from just one campaign."},
  {name:"Jayant P.", desg:"Solo Agent", review:"I didn’t have time to figure out ads or SEO — I just needed leads. These guys set everything up, and now I get at least 3–4 qualified leads a day. It’s taken a huge load off my shoulders."},
